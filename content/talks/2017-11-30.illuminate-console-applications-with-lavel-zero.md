While it's fun to write little one-off utility scripts,
sometimes you need to write real console apps.
One that takes arguments and plays nicely with UNIX
conventions for input, output or error reporting.

In this talk, I have showed Laravel Zero, a micro-framework
that leverages an unofficial and customized version of
Laravel to provide an elegant starting point for your console app.
